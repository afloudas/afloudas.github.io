Ok, so I guess I'm at that stage where I'm not sure if I know what I'm doing, but then again, I feel so smart when I understand a new line of code or a new way to write it. Life gets in the way but I'm getting down to the lesson at hand. What I'm saying is, I need more time to understand all this code. I will be back shortly to report if I've made it far.
